#During the fine-tuning process, the pre-trained BERT model showed steady improvement in performance on the IMDb sentiment 
# classification task. Over the course of three training epochs, the training loss consistently decreased, and the evaluation 
#metrics demonstrated that the model was successfully learning the underlying patterns of the dataset. The final evaluation accuracy 
#indicated that the model could distinguish between positive and negative sentiment with a high degree of confidence, validating the 
#effectiveness of transfer learning in NLP. One minor challenge encountered was ensuring that tokenization and data formatting were 
#properly aligned with PyTorch tensors expected by the Trainer API. Additionally, installing compatible versions of transformers and 
#dependencies like accelerate was necessary for a successful run. Overall, the experiment confirmed that BERT can be fine-tuned with 
#relatively little data to achieve solid results on downstream classification tasks.
